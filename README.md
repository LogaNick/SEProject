# Issues Tracking

The team uses GitHub Issues and Milestones for tracking ongoing development and release cycles.  Labels are based on the [Sane GitHub Labels](https://medium.com/@dave_lunny/sane-github-labels-c5d2e6004b63) approach, with certain adaptations adopted from the open source [TEAMMATES](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates) project.

There are three major label categories:

1. Priority: Urgency of the issue as it relates to Milestone and dependence of other issues. 
   1. Urgent: Issues that are top priority and critical to a Milestone and/or issues with dependency.
   1. High: Issues that have affect the functionality and/or ability to continue development of other issues.
   1. Medium: Issues that have no impact on other issues, but are important to achieving a milestone.
   1. Low: Issues that have no impact on other issues, do not impact the logical correctness of a feature, or may be pushed to a different milestone

1. Status: What state an issue is currently in.
   1. Abandoned: Removed from the current iteration, and should be reviewed for inclusion in the next iteration.
   1. Accepted: Accepted for inclusion in the current iteration.
   1. Complete: Completely integrated into the master branch, and no further work should be required.
   1. In Progress: Currently being handled by the assigned team member.
   1. In Review: Under code and correctness evaluation.
   1. Merge: Issue reviewed, passes integration and unit testing, and is waiting to be merged.
   1. On Hold: Waiting for progress required with other isues, or awaiting assessment for being abandoned.
   1. Review Needed: Unit and integration tests pass, awaiting for code and correctness evaluation.

1. Type: The type of issue
   1. Bug: Issue related to a bug in another issue
   1. Enhancement: Proposed change to a feature to improve it's design
   1. Project Management: Issues or tasks not directly related to code, but instead focused on coordination of project management
   1. Question: Questions about code, features, or other related things.
   1. Refactor: Code that has been refactored from a previous version.
   1. Unit Test: Code related to unit tests that have been written.
   1. User Story: User stories associated with a Milestone.  All other issues, except project management, should be associated with one or more user stories.
